just some simple functions for showing one svg file on the web. i use clojurescript, reagent and boot as a build tool.
all you need is java and boot to be installed.
clone the repo, cd in the directory litle-boat and execute the command build dev.
after the execution of the command go to localhost:3000 to see my beautiful little boat!
